## Deriving AES encryption/decryption key using user password

The encryption key is derived from the user password and salt using the **PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2)** algorithm. Here's how it works:

1. **Password and Salt**: The user's password and a randomly generated salt are input to the PBKDF2HMAC function.

   * The **salt** is a random string of bytes, ensuring that even if two users have the same password, their keys will still be different.

2. **Key Derivation**:

   * The PBKDF2 algorithm is used to generate a cryptographic key based on the password and salt.
   * **SHA-256** is used as the hashing algorithm within PBKDF2.
   * The function applies multiple iterations (default is 100,000) of the hash function to make it more computationally expensive and harder to brute-force.

3. **Generated Key**: The output of the PBKDF2HMAC function is the derived cryptographic key, which is used for encryption and decryption operations (in this case, AES encryption).

This key is **not the same as the user password**, but it is derived from it, and it will be used to encrypt and decrypt data securely.

---

### Key Steps in Code:

```python
kdf = PBKDF2HMAC(
    algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),  # SHA-256 hash function
    length=32,  # The length of the derived key (256 bits for AES-256)
    salt=salt,  # Salt used to make the key derivation unique
    iterations=iterations,  # Number of iterations to make key derivation slow and secure
    backend=default_backend()  # Cryptographic backend to use for operations
)

# Derive the key (this is a 256-bit AES key)
derived_key = kdf.derive(password.encode())  # The password is encoded to bytes
```



In this code:

* The **salt** ensures that the same password will result in a different key each time it's used.
* The **iterations** make it computationally expensive to generate the key, protecting against brute-force attacks.

The derived key will then be used with AES encryption (AES-GCM in this case) for encrypting and decrypting data securely.

## 🔑 Why decryption still works with a different salt each time:

Even though the salt is random each time, **you store it alongside the encrypted data**. That way, when the user wants to decrypt something, you:

1. **Retrieve the stored salt** (which was used during encryption),
2. Use the user’s password + that specific salt to re-derive the same key,
3. Decrypt the data with that key.

---

### 🔁 Think of it like this:

For each message, you're doing:

```python
salt = os.urandom(16)
key = derive_key(password, salt)
ciphertext = encrypt(data, key)
store(salt, ciphertext)
```

Then during decryption:

```python
salt = load_stored_salt()
key = derive_key(password, salt)
data = decrypt(ciphertext, key)
```

You **don’t reuse the salt** — you just **store it per message or file**. That way, even if every piece of data has a different salt (and thus different keys), each one can still be decrypted because its salt is known.

---

#### ✅ Summary:

* Salt = public
* Password = secret
* Key = derived from both
* Salt must be saved with the data for decryption

---


## IS new AES key is generated each time

Yes, you're right in **observing** that a new key is generated **each time you use a new salt**.

Let me clarify how it works:

---

### 🔐 **Key Derivation from Password + Salt**

Every time you do this:

```python
key = PBKDF2HMAC(..., salt=salt, ...).derive(password)
```

The **key is derived from both the password and the salt**.

---

### ✅ So why use a random salt?

* The salt **prevents precomputed attacks** (like rainbow tables).
* Even if two users use the same password, **different salts → different keys**.
* It makes brute-force attacks **much harder**.

---

### ⚠️ But yes — **if you use a *different* salt next time**, the same password will produce a **different key**.

---

### 🧠 **How to handle this correctly**

* When you **create a key**, **generate a random salt**.
* Then **store the salt** securely **alongside the encrypted data** (e.g., in a database, or even prepended to the ciphertext).
* Later, when decrypting, **retrieve the same salt** and **use it again with the same password** to regenerate the same key.

That way:

```plaintext
same password + same salt → same key → successful decryption ✅
```

But:

```plaintext
same password + different salt → different key → decryption fails ❌
```

---

### 🔄 Summary

* Yes, using a **different salt each time** results in a **different key**, even with the same password.
* This is **by design** — and why the **salt must be stored** if you want to reproduce the key later.

Would you like a clear code example that shows encrypting with a salt and saving it, then decrypting using the saved salt?


## Using AESGCM mode

Great catch — and you're absolutely right to be curious. Let's walk through this carefully:

---

### 🔐 AES Modes: Padding Required vs Not

There are **two types of AES encryption modes** to consider here:

| AES Mode            | Requires Manual Padding?  | Authenticated (Integrity-Checked)? |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **ECB / CBC**       | ✅ Yes (must pad manually) | ❌ No                               |
| **GCM / CCM / EAX** | ❌ No padding needed       | ✅ Yes                              |

---

### ✅ Why Padding Was *Not* Needed in This Case

You're using **AES-GCM** (`AESGCM` class from `cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead`). This is a **stream cipher mode**, and it **does *not* require padding**. Here's why:

> AES-GCM handles plaintext of **any length**, because it encrypts in chunks internally — similar to a stream cipher. It does not expect the input to be block-aligned (like 16, 32, 48 bytes etc.).

So this line works just fine:

```python
ciphertext = aesgcm.encrypt(iv, plaintext.encode(), None)
```

Even if `plaintext.encode()` is 7 bytes, 23 bytes, or 75 bytes — **no padding needed**.

---

### 🚫 If You Were Using AES-CBC Instead…

If you had used CBC mode like:

```python
cipher = Cipher(algorithms.AES(key), modes.CBC(iv))
```

Then you *must* pad manually, otherwise you’ll get:

```
ValueError: The length of the provided data is not a multiple of the block length.
```

---

### ✅ Summary

* Your original code **uses AES-GCM**, which **doesn't require padding**.
* That's why you could encrypt any-length string and it still worked.
* If you switched to ECB or CBC, you'd need to manually pad using `Crypto.Util.Padding` or similar.


### Integrity-Checked

Great question.

### ✅ Integrity-Checked (or *Authenticated Encryption*)

When we say an encryption mode is **integrity-checked**, we mean:

> It **verifies** during decryption that the data hasn’t been **modified, corrupted, or tampered with**.

This is a **crucial security feature**, especially if encrypted data is sent over a network or stored where someone might try to alter it.

---

### 🔍 Why This Matters

* If you **just encrypt data (like with AES-CBC)**, it protects **confidentiality** (the attacker can’t read it).
* But if someone **modifies even 1 byte** of the ciphertext (or IV), CBC will decrypt garbage — and you won’t know it.
* With **AES-GCM**, decryption **fails completely** if the ciphertext or IV is tampered with. It **detects and rejects** corrupted data.

This is what makes AES-GCM an **"authenticated encryption mode" (AEAD)**.

---

### 🔐 Example

Let’s say we encrypt `"The eagle has landed."` with AES-GCM and later someone modifies the encrypted text.

```python
# When decrypting with AES-GCM
plaintext = aesgcm.decrypt(iv, tampered_ciphertext, None)
```

You'll get:

```
cryptography.exceptions.InvalidTag: Authentication tag mismatch
```

This error tells you **something was altered** — and the system **refuses to give you any decrypted data**.

---

### 🔐 TL;DR

| Mode    | Keeps Data Secret? | Detects Tampering? |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| AES-CBC | ✅ Yes              | ❌ No               |
| AES-GCM | ✅ Yes              | ✅ Yes              |

If you're storing user conversations or sensitive data, **always prefer AES-GCM or another AEAD** (authenticated encryption with associated data) mode.

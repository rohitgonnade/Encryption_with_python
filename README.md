## Deriving AES encryption/decryption key using user password

The encryption key is derived from the user password and salt using the **PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2)** algorithm. Here's how it works:

1. **Password and Salt**: The user's password and a randomly generated salt are input to the PBKDF2HMAC function.

   * The **salt** is a random string of bytes, ensuring that even if two users have the same password, their keys will still be different.

2. **Key Derivation**:

   * The PBKDF2 algorithm is used to generate a cryptographic key based on the password and salt.
   * **SHA-256** is used as the hashing algorithm within PBKDF2.
   * The function applies multiple iterations (default is 100,000) of the hash function to make it more computationally expensive and harder to brute-force.

3. **Generated Key**: The output of the PBKDF2HMAC function is the derived cryptographic key, which is used for encryption and decryption operations (in this case, AES encryption).

This key is **not the same as the user password**, but it is derived from it, and it will be used to encrypt and decrypt data securely.

### Key Steps in Code:

```python
kdf = PBKDF2HMAC(
    algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),  # SHA-256 hash function
    length=32,  # The length of the derived key (256 bits for AES-256)
    salt=salt,  # Salt used to make the key derivation unique
    iterations=iterations,  # Number of iterations to make key derivation slow and secure
    backend=default_backend()  # Cryptographic backend to use for operations
)

# Derive the key (this is a 256-bit AES key)
derived_key = kdf.derive(password.encode())  # The password is encoded to bytes
```



In this code:

* The **salt** ensures that the same password will result in a different key each time it's used.
* The **iterations** make it computationally expensive to generate the key, protecting against brute-force attacks.

The derived key will then be used with AES encryption (AES-GCM in this case) for encrypting and decrypting data securely.

## üîë Why decryption still works with a different salt each time:

Even though the salt is random each time, **you store it alongside the encrypted data**. That way, when the user wants to decrypt something, you:

1. **Retrieve the stored salt** (which was used during encryption),
2. Use the user‚Äôs password + that specific salt to re-derive the same key,
3. Decrypt the data with that key.

---

### üîÅ Think of it like this:

For each message, you're doing:

```python
salt = os.urandom(16)
key = derive_key(password, salt)
ciphertext = encrypt(data, key)
store(salt, ciphertext)
```

Then during decryption:

```python
salt = load_stored_salt()
key = derive_key(password, salt)
data = decrypt(ciphertext, key)
```

You **don‚Äôt reuse the salt** ‚Äî you just **store it per message or file**. That way, even if every piece of data has a different salt (and thus different keys), each one can still be decrypted because its salt is known.

---

#### ‚úÖ Summary:

* Salt = public
* Password = secret
* Key = derived from both
* Salt must be saved with the data for decryption

---


## IS new AES key is generated each time

Yes, you're right in **observing** that a new key is generated **each time you use a new salt**.

Let me clarify how it works:

---

### üîê **Key Derivation from Password + Salt**

Every time you do this:

```python
key = PBKDF2HMAC(..., salt=salt, ...).derive(password)
```

The **key is derived from both the password and the salt**.

---

### ‚úÖ So why use a random salt?

* The salt **prevents precomputed attacks** (like rainbow tables).
* Even if two users use the same password, **different salts ‚Üí different keys**.
* It makes brute-force attacks **much harder**.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è But yes ‚Äî **if you use a *different* salt next time**, the same password will produce a **different key**.

---

### üß† **How to handle this correctly**

* When you **create a key**, **generate a random salt**.
* Then **store the salt** securely **alongside the encrypted data** (e.g., in a database, or even prepended to the ciphertext).
* Later, when decrypting, **retrieve the same salt** and **use it again with the same password** to regenerate the same key.

That way:

```plaintext
same password + same salt ‚Üí same key ‚Üí successful decryption ‚úÖ
```

But:

```plaintext
same password + different salt ‚Üí different key ‚Üí decryption fails ‚ùå
```

---

### üîÑ Summary

* Yes, using a **different salt each time** results in a **different key**, even with the same password.
* This is **by design** ‚Äî and why the **salt must be stored** if you want to reproduce the key later.

Would you like a clear code example that shows encrypting with a salt and saving it, then decrypting using the saved salt?
